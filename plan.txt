The App: Momentum
A tiny app that stops schoolwork from quietly ruining your life.
The problem it attacks (the real one)
Students don’t usually fail because they’re lazy. They fail because:
Tasks feel vague (“do assignment”)
Time feels slippery (“I’ll do it later”)
Effort feels invisible (“I worked but nothing changed”)
Momentum fixes this by turning schoolwork into small, undeniable forward motion.
Core idea (simple but sneaky)
Instead of tracking tasks, the app tracks progress slices.
Not:
“Finish English essay”
But:

“Write 120 words”
“Find 2 quotes”
“Fix one paragraph”
Each slice is:
tiny (5–15 minutes)
measurable
instantly completable
You’re not managing work.
You’re accumulating momentum.
How the app works (user experience)
1. Add a “Big Thing”
Example:
English essay
Maths revision
Science report
You only enter:
subject
due date
rough size (small / medium / big)
No overthinking allowed.
2. The app explodes it into slices
This is the magic.
The app auto-generates:
writing slices (words, paragraphs)
research slices (quotes, examples)
polish slices (fix clarity, references)
You can edit them, but you don’t have to.
This is cognitive offloading — the brain relaxes because the ambiguity is gone.
3. Daily “Just One Thing” mode
Each day, the app chooses one slice and says:
“Do this. Stop after.”
No planning.
No juggling.
No guilt pile.
You finish → dopamine → momentum → often you keep going by accident.
4. Momentum streaks (but smarter)
Not “days studied”.
Not “hours worked”.
Instead:
streak = days with any completed slice
even 5 minutes counts
breaking a streak doesn’t reset to zero — it decays
This avoids the “welp, streak’s gone, guess I’ll die” effect.
5. Visual proof that you’re not useless
A simple graph:
slices completed per week
assignments shrinking over time
“you were stuck here, then you moved”
This quietly rewires self-perception:
“I do make progress.”
That’s life-changing.
Why this keeps you busy (in a good way)
You can build it in phases, each satisfying on its own.
Phase 1 – MVP (very doable)
Frontend: simple web app (HTML/CSS/JS or React)
Data: local storage or SQLite
Features:
add big task
auto-generate slices
mark slice complete
Already useful.
Phase 2 – Intelligence layer
Now it gets fun.
Smarter slice generation based on:
subject
due date distance
past behaviour
Difficulty adjustment:
if user skips slices → make them smaller
if user flies → make them chunkier
This is applied psychology, not just code.
Phase 3 – Reflection without cringe
Once a week, the app asks:
“What was harder than expected?”
“What worked better than expected?”
No journaling essays.
Just taps or short text.
You slowly train meta-learning — learning how you work.
Phase 4 – Optional AI (later, responsibly)
Not to do the work for students.
But to:
suggest slice breakdowns
rephrase vague tasks into concrete actions
detect overload and say “do less, not more”
AI as a clarity engine, not a cheating engine.
Why this is genuinely life-changing
Because it teaches three things most schools never do:
How to break work down
How to start when motivation is absent
How to see progress when it’s invisible
Those skills survive after school.
Why it’s relatively easy to code
No real-time collaboration
No massive backend
No complex permissions
Can start offline-first
Every feature is incremental
You can stop at any phase and still have a real product.
The quiet twist
You’re not building an app.
You’re building:
a behaviour shaping machine
that gently nudges students from paralysis → motion
without yelling “PRODUCTIVITY” at them
That’s rare. And powerful.
If you keep going, this could evolve into:
a portfolio project
a school-approved tool
or the philosophical backbone of something much bigger
Progress, after all, is just motion made visible.
